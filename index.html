        <h1>The trip there</h1>
        <p>Towards the end of my trip to Thailand, having heard that there was some good snorkeling 
         around the Similian islands 40 or so miles off the west coast of the Thai peninsula, I decided to give it a go.  
         The seas had been a bit choppy, waves 2 to 4 feet, but I didn’t have many days left so I booked a day trip on one of the speed boat/snorkeling tours.
         Abraham, the dutch owner of the tour company, gave me the best advice and told me that since it would 
         be a rather rough two and a half hour trip out there, I should sit as close to the stern of the boat as possible.
         So me and 35 other day trip snorkeling tourists boarded a 45 ft. long speed boat for the bumpy
         ride out there.  Every 45 seconds or so for the next 2 and a half hours, the boat would crest a 
         wave and you’d get that sudden negative g roller coaster ride feeling.  
        </p>
        <h1>In the water</h1>
        <p>While the ride out was a little rough, the snorkeling areas were sheltered and were 
            no problem at all for snorkeling.  At the second of the three location we visited, the pillow corals were particularly striking, with 
            a striking black and neon yellow patterning.  It was fairly easy to get rather close to schools of sergant fish,
            especially since they quickly figured out that they could swim much faster and with more agility 
            than I could.  In fact the parrot and clown fish and all their friends came to that 
            conclusion as well and didn't seem too bothered by us snorkelers.  Thanks to Disney anamation, the 
            clown fish are called Nemo fish by the Thai guides.  As you swim towards them, they will 
            stop the business of swimming through their hoast sea anemone and face you, like a tiny sentinal as if 
            to ask 'ok, what are you going to do now.  My anemone's tenticles can sting and if I need to I can still 
            swim faster than you'.  All in all, it was a good little trip even if the ride out was a little bumpy.
